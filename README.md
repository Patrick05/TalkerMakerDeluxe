# TalkerMakerDeluxe
A FOSS Non-Linear Game Dialogue Editor

This system is designed to work with Dialogue System in Unity (via an XML exporter), generally, but saves primarily to a JSON format that you can do anything you like with.

Fork it, fix it, come pretty up the advertising, do whatever. I'll gladly roll in code changes.

There is [no Code of Conduct](https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC) for this project.
