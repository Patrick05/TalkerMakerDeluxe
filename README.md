A FOSS Non-Linear Game Dialogue Editor

This system is designed to work with Dialogue System in Unity (via an XML exporter), generally, but saves primarily to a JSON format that you can do anything you like with.

Current TODO is to add Deletion Logic, everything is pretty back burner.

Fork it, fix it, come pretty up the advertising, do whatever. I'll gladly roll in code changes.

There is [no Code of Conduct](https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC) for this project.
